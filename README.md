This repository houses the "Port the Patches" game, which was used to test the effectiveness of "Serious Games" in teaching teenagers about the consequences of plastic production and spread awareness of the garbage patches (like the great pacific garbage patch). In regards to the effectiveness of "Serious Games", the game showed that teenagers were more susceptible to the knowledge gained through this game.

## About the game
The game is an incremental game with a day-cycle, where at the end of the day, the player is presented with a set of choices. Depending on the player's choice, the accumulation rate of plastic will increase with a varying amount. Before a new set of choices is presented to the player, an adaptive animation is presented, showcasing how much plastic they have generated into their own little plastic patch. The goal of the game is to get the highest score, which is directly tied to how big the garbage patch is - in other words, the more plastic generated, the higher the score.

Because the game is set on choices, the game cannot continue endlessly like other incremental games, and is limited to a fixed set of rounds, before being presented with an end screen.
